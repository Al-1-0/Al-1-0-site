<h1 class="h1-white">S&S Software 2019</h1>

					 <p>In 2019, Al took a remote position in a VR, motion capture and animation start-up.</p>
					 <p>Al's job was to develop and build the website, create a document system for the business, and curate and organise content for marketing use.</p>
				     <p>The team were full of creatives such as video games writers, animators, programmers, lighting and pyrotechnic experts, and 3D graphics specialists.</p>
					 <p>The start-up ran into some difficulties and ceased business in Dec 2019 when one of its directors and key visionaries had to leave for financial reasons - which left the whole project unfinished and abandoned after several months of hard work.</p>
				     <p>The experience was incredible for Al, and a great eye-opener into the highs and lows of being a part of a company from scratch.</p>
					 <p>The video belows shows Seb and the team in action at the studio in Oradea, Romania - capturing kickboxing, dancing, and swordplay!</p>
					 <p>The music is taken from "Western Reverbs" by <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/brooklynzhen">Brooklynzhen</a></strong>, (an electronic music project Al does sometimes). </p>
